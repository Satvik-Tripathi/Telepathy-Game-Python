# Telepathy Guessing Game

A simple console-based game built in Python where the user tries to "match" a random computer choice across three categories (fruits, chocolates, and games).

This was a personal project for my first-semester CSE resume.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

* Implemented core game logic using the `random` module.
* Managed game state by tracking and updating a `points` variable.
* Handled user input, including string manipulation (`.lower()`) and validation.
* Wrote and read from an external `.txt` file to store and update a persistent high score.
* Used defensive programming to handle the edge case of an empty or new high score file.

## How to Run

1.  Make sure you have Python installed.
2.  Download the `your_filename_here.py` file.
3.  Run it from your terminal: `python your_filename_here.py`
